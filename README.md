#Course on Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains materials related to my course on Data Structures and Algorithms at the Diego Portales University. The course covers topics such as algorithm analysis, data structures (e.g., arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs), sorting and searching algorithms, and more.

In addition, I've included some of the code that I've gathered during my time in the Competitive Programming course at Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile. These resources include solutions of the problems I've faced and tips on how to approach and solve programming challenges.

Feel free to use these materials.

If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to contact me. Happy coding!
