# Collatz Algorithm

This repository contains my implementation of the Collatz algorithm, which is a procedure that takes a positive integer as input and generates a sequence of numbers by applying specific rules until the input value reaches 1.

## Problem Description

The Collatz algorithm works as follows:

1. If the input number N is even, the algorithm divides it by 2.
2. If the input number N is odd, the algorithm multiplies it by 3 and adds 1.
3. The algorithm repeats the above steps until N becomes 1.

The goal is to generate the sequence for any given positive integer N.

## Input

The input consists of a single positive integer N.

## Output

The output is a single line containing the sequence for the given input N.

## Example

Input: 3

Output: 3 10 5 16 8 4 2 1



**In this folder you will find the code and test cases demonstrating the implementation of the Collatz algorithm.**
